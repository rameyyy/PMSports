Key Insights:
- Betting market odds dominate (top 4 features are market data)
- Spread points matter more than individual moneyline odds
- Model learns to weight consensus (avg_ml) heavily
- Team strength differentials still important (#12, #13, #14)
- High regularization (L1=5, L2=5) suppresses low-value features from causing overfitting
