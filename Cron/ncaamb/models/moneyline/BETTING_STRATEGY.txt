BETTING STRATEGY GUIDE - 2025 NCAA Basketball Season
Based on LGB + Good Bets Model Analysis
================================================================================

KEY FINDINGS FROM ANALYSIS:
-----------
- LGB EV vs ROI Correlation: 0.6559 (strong predictor)
- Good Bets Model helps identify profitable opportunities
- Best ROI ranges: EV >= 5% (71% ROI) to EV >= 20% (178% ROI)
- Historical data shows $10 bet sizing with clear profit potential

================================================================================
STRATEGY OPTIONS
================================================================================

STRATEGY 1: ULTRA CONSERVATIVE (Low Risk, Steady Returns)
----------------------------------------------------------
Use Case: You want consistent, reliable profits with minimal drawdown

Parameters:
  - EV Threshold:        >= 10%
  - Good Bets Prob:      >= 0.65 (strong confidence)
  - Bet Size:            $5-10 per bet
  - Expected Frequency:  50-100 bets/season

Expected Performance:
  - Win Rate:            ~50-60% (based on historical EV>10%)
  - ROI:                 +126% (based on EV bins analysis)
  - Total Season Profit: +$2,500-5,000 (on $2,000-5,000 wagered)
  - Max Drawdown:        ~$500-1,000

Rationale:
  - EV >= 10% = only top-tier bets
  - High good bets confidence reduces false positives
  - Small bet size limits losses
  - Fewer bets = easier to track and analyze

Action Items:
  1. Filter games where LGB EV >= 0.10 (10%)
  2. Check good bets model confidence >= 0.65
  3. Only bet on games with clear model agreement
  4. Track all bets in spreadsheet

---

STRATEGY 2: MODERATE (Balanced Risk/Reward)
--------------------------------------------
Use Case: Balance between profit potential and acceptable risk

Parameters:
  - EV Threshold:        >= 5%
  - Good Bets Prob:      >= 0.55 (decent confidence)
  - Bet Size:            $10-15 per bet
  - Expected Frequency:  200-350 bets/season

Expected Performance:
  - Win Rate:            ~55-65%
  - ROI:                 +71% (based on EV 5%-10% range)
  - Total Season Profit: +$3,500-7,500 (on $5,000-10,000 wagered)
  - Max Drawdown:        ~$1,500-2,500

Rationale:
  - EV >= 5% = sweet spot for volume + profitability
  - Moderate good bets threshold captures more opportunities
  - Medium bet size scales with volume
  - Still conservative enough to survive bad runs

Action Items:
  1. Filter games where LGB EV >= 0.05 (5%)
  2. Check good bets model confidence >= 0.55
  3. Expect to make 2-3 bets per game day
  4. Set aside bankroll for variance (need $5-10k minimum)

---

STRATEGY 3: AGGRESSIVE (High Volume, Higher Risk)
--------------------------------------------------
Use Case: Maximize profit potential, have large bankroll to absorb variance

Parameters:
  - EV Threshold:        >= 0% (all positive EV)
  - Good Bets Prob:      >= 0.50 (any positive signal)
  - Bet Size:            $15-25 per bet
  - Expected Frequency:  600-1,000 bets/season

Expected Performance:
  - Win Rate:            ~50-55%
  - ROI:                 +11% (based on overall positive EV data)
  - Total Season Profit: +$3,300-5,500 (on $30,000-50,000 wagered)
  - Max Drawdown:        ~$5,000-10,000

Rationale:
  - EV >= 0% = ALL bets have positive expected value
  - Volumetric approach - law of large numbers helps
  - Bigger bet sizes leverage the edge
  - Need significant bankroll to weather swings

Risks:
  - High variance during bad luck streaks
  - Requires discipline to avoid "revenge betting"
  - Need $25-50k bankroll minimum

Action Items:
  1. Filter games where LGB EV >= 0.00 (0%)
  2. Place bets on all positive EV opportunities
  3. Strict position sizing: never bet more than 0.5% of bankroll per bet
  4. Track Kelly Criterion for optimal sizing

---

STRATEGY 4: OPPORTUNISTIC (Cherry-Pick Best Spots)
---------------------------------------------------
Use Case: Only bet on highest confidence, highest EV opportunities

Parameters:
  - EV Threshold:        >= 15%
  - Good Bets Prob:      >= 0.70 (very high confidence)
  - Model Agreement:     XGB and LGB probs within 5%
  - Bet Size:            $20-50 per bet
  - Expected Frequency:  30-80 bets/season

Expected Performance:
  - Win Rate:            ~70%+ (elite bets only)
  - ROI:                 +200%+ (based on EV>15% bins)
  - Total Season Profit: +$2,000-4,000 (on $1,000-2,000 wagered)
  - Max Drawdown:        ~$300-500

Rationale:
  - Only bet when models STRONGLY align
  - EV >= 15% = true outlier opportunities
  - High bet sizes on high confidence = maximize EV
  - Fewer bets = more focused analysis

Risks:
  - May miss profitable middle-ground bets
  - Requires patience (only 5-7 bets per week)
  - Need discipline not to lower standards

Action Items:
  1. Filter XGB EV >= 0.15 AND LGB EV >= 0.15
  2. Check XGB and LGB probs agreement (within 0.05)
  3. Verify good bets model >= 0.70 confidence
  4. Only bet on these elite opportunities

RECOMMENDATION FRAMEWORK
================================================================================

CHOOSE STRATEGY BASED ON:

Bankroll Available:
  < $2,000      --> Ultra Conservative (STRATEGY 1)
  $2,000-5,000  --> Moderate (STRATEGY 2)

  >20 hrs/week  --> Aggressive (STRATEGY 3) - more bets to track

Profit Goals:
  $2,000/season --> Ultra Conservative (STRATEGY 1)
  $5,000/season --> Moderate (STRATEGY 2)
  $10,000+/season--> Aggressive (STRATEGY 3)

================================================================================
IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST
================================================================================

Pre-Season Setup:
  ☐ Choose strategy (1-4)
  ☐ Determine betting bankroll amount
  ☐ Set up betting tracking spreadsheet
  ☐ Establish unit size ($5, $10, $15, $20, $25, $50)
  ☐ Create betting rules document

Daily/Weekly Process:
  ☐ Run LGB model on upcoming games
  ☐ Calculate EV for all games
  ☐ Get good bets model predictions
  ☐ Filter games by strategy criteria
  ☐ Place bets within 48 hours of game
  ☐ Record all bets: date, teams, EV, odds, prediction

Post-Game:
  ☐ Record actual result (win/loss)
  ☐ Calculate ROI for each bet
  ☐ Update season statistics
  ☐ Weekly review: track ROI vs expected

End of Month:
  ☐ Analyze biggest winners/losers
  ☐ Check if actual ROI matches model predictions
  ☐ Adjust strategy if needed
  ☐ Review model performance on those games

================================================================================
RED FLAGS & ADJUSTMENTS
================================================================================

If Actual ROI < Expected by >10%:
  - Model may have degraded
  - Retrain on fresh 2021-2024 data
  - Check if recent games have different characteristics
  - Potentially lower EV threshold temporarily

If You Hit a 5+ Game Losing Streak:
  - DON'T lower standards (variance is normal)
  - DON'T bet larger to recover losses (risking ruin)
  - Increase bet size only if up 50%+ for season

If Good Bets Model Accuracy < 50%:
  - Stop using good bets threshold
  - Revert to pure LGB EV-only filtering
  - Investigate if 2025 season has shifted dynamics

If Win Rate Stays Below 45% After 100+ Bets:
  - Major issue - probably data leakage or model degradation
  - Halt betting immediately
  - Debug: compare predictions to actual outcomes
  - Retrain models from scratch

================================================================================
EXAMPLE SEASON PROJECTION (Moderate Strategy, 300 bets, $10/bet)
================================================================================

Wagered:           $3,000 (300 bets × $10)
Expected Win Rate: 60% (180 wins, 120 losses)
Expected Profit:   +$2,130 (71% ROI from EV 5%-10% range)

Month-by-Month Variance:
  December (60 bets):  +$400 to +$800
  January (80 bets):   +$500 to +$1,000
  February (80 bets):  +$400 to +$900
  March (80 bets):     +$300 to +$800

Breakeven Point:     ~50 bets (should hit by mid-December)
Confidence Interval: +$1,200 to +$3,000 (accounting for variance)

================================================================================
FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

START HERE: Moderate Strategy (STRATEGY 2)
Reason: Good balance for most bettors, manageable workload, proven profitability

Once You Have 1-2 Weeks of Results:
  - If hitting expected ROI -> stick with it or adjust volume
  - If underperforming -> lower EV threshold to capture more bets
  - If overperforming -> raise EV threshold for higher quality

Monitor These Metrics Weekly:
  1. Actual Win Rate vs Expected (should track closely)
  2. ROI vs Expected (variance is normal ±20%)
  3. Number of bets available (ensures pipeline)
  4. Model agreement between XGB and LGB

Season Milestones:
  After 50 bets:   First statistical significance check
  After 100 bets:  Confident in model performance
  After 300+ bets: Can trust season projections
