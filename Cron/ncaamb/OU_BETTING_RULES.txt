COMPLETE BETTING RULES - PRECISE IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE
====================================================================================================

📐 HOW TO CALCULATE DIFFERENCE:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Difference = Your Predicted Total - Sportsbook Line

  Examples:
    • Line is 150, you predict 154  →  Difference = 154 - 150 = +4.0
    • Line is 145, you predict 143  →  Difference = 143 - 145 = -2.0
    • Line is 140, you predict 139.7 →  Difference = 139.7 - 140 = -0.3

🔥 OVER BET RULES (Bet when ANY of these 4 rules are true)
====================================================================================================

Rule 1:
  IF confidence >= 0.75 AND confidence < 0.80
  AND difference >= 3.0 AND difference < 5.0
  THEN bet OVER
  Performance: 251 bets | 55.0% win rate | +5.50% ROI

Rule 2:
  IF confidence >= 0.90
  THEN bet OVER (any difference)
  Performance: 19 bets | 57.9% win rate | +11.11% ROI

Rule 3:
  IF difference >= 6.0 AND difference < 6.5
  THEN bet OVER (any confidence)
  Performance: 25 bets | 72.0% win rate | +37.99% ROI

Rule 4:
  IF difference >= 3.5 AND difference < 4.0
  THEN bet OVER (any confidence)
  Performance: 152 bets | 54.6% win rate | +4.80% ROI

⚠️  NOTE: Rule 1 and Rule 4 overlap when conf is [0.75, 0.80) AND diff is [3.5, 4.0)
         This is fine - just bet OVER once, don't double bet!
