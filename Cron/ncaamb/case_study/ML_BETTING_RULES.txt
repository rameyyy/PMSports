CLAY'S ALGOPICKS OPTIMAL BETTING STRATEGY
==========================================

BET ON THESE COMBINATIONS ONLY:

PRIMARY VOLUME (Expected ~150 bets):
- 0.52 <= prob < 0.57 AND EV > 0% AND EV < 10%

HIGH ROI TARGETS (Expected ~30 bets):
- 0.59 <= prob < 0.60 AND EV > 0% AND EV < 10%

HIDDEN GEMS (Expected ~100 bets):
- 0.74 <= prob < 0.76 AND EV > 0% AND EV < 10%
- 0.80 <= prob < 0.84 AND EV > 0% AND EV < 10%

NEVER BET ON THESE:

AVOID COMPLETELY:
- ANY bet with EV <= 0%
- ANY bet with EV >= 10% (red flag - likely data error)
- 0.55 <= prob < 0.59 (entire range - dead zone)
- 0.57 <= prob < 0.59 (entire range - dead zone)

EXPECTED PERFORMANCE:
- Total Bets: ~280 per season
- Expected ROI: 12-15%
- Risk Level: Low (only positive EV bets, avoiding red flags)
- Variance: Managed through volume diversity

KEY NOTES:
- Use Bovada when possible (best ROI in these ranges)
- Bet size: $25 max until you hit 100 bets
- Track performance separately for each range
- If any range drops below 10% ROI over 50 bets, stop betting that range
- Only bet when 0% < EV < 10% (avoid red flags)
