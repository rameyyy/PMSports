📐 HOW TO CALCULATE DIFFERENCE:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Difference = Your Predicted Total - Sportsbook Line

  Examples:
    • Line is 150, you predict 154  →  Difference = 154 - 150 = +4.0
    • Line is 145, you predict 143  →  Difference = 143 - 145 = -2.0
    • Line is 140, you predict 139.7 →  Difference = 139.7 - 140 = -0.3

💡 KEY INSIGHTS
====================================================================================================

1. COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH WINS
   - Using 26 total rules (13 OVER + 13 UNDER) captures maximum edge
   - Multiple filtering approaches (3D, 2D-diff, 2D-conf) each find unique opportunities

2. OVER BETS: Multiple pathways to profitability
   - 3D filtering (all 3 params) for high-confidence, high-difference bets
   - 2D filtering with difference for moderate good_bet_scores
   - 2D filtering with ensemble_conf for specific confidence zones

3. UNDER BETS: Simpler signals work better
   - good_bet_score + difference is primary filter
   - good_bet_score + ensemble_conf provides complementary windows
   - UNDER has higher ROI (+12.03%) than OVER (+9.12%)

4. good_bet_score RANGES reveal patterns:
   - OVER: Profitable at 0.50+ (any signal towards OVER)
   - UNDER: Profitable at 0.00-0.45 (strong to moderate UNDER signals)

5. DIFFERENCE patterns:
   - OVER: +1.0 to +5.0 points = profitable zones
   - UNDER: -4.0 to +1.0 points = profitable zones (including near-line)

====================================================================================================
🔧 IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY
====================================================================================================

For production deployment:

TIER 1 - HIGHEST ROI (20%+ ROI):
  - OVER: O4, O10, O11 (3 rules, 123 bets, ~24% avg ROI)
  - UNDER: U1, U2, U9, U10 (4 rules, 170 bets, ~25% avg ROI)

TIER 2 - HIGH ROI (10-20% ROI):
  - OVER: O5, O6 (2 rules, 118 bets, ~13.6% avg ROI)
  - UNDER: U3, U4, U5, U6, U11 (5 rules, 233 bets, ~17% avg ROI)

TIER 3 - SOLID ROI (4-10% ROI):
  - OVER: O2, O3, O7, O8, O9, O12, O13 (7 rules, 471 bets, ~5% avg ROI)
  - UNDER: U7, U8, U12, U13 (4 rules, 169 bets, ~6.5% avg ROI)

Strategy: Start with Tier 1 for conservative approach, add Tier 2 for balanced, add Tier 3 for maximum volume.

====================================================================================================
OPERATOR NOTES
====================================================================================================

All operators use:
  >= (greater than or equal to) for LOWER bounds
  <  (less than) for UPPER bounds

Variables:
  - good_bet_score: Direction signal (0=UNDER, 1=OVER)
  - ensemble_confidence: Quality/certainty of total prediction
  - difference: predicted_total - line

Rule overlap is intentional - a single game may trigger multiple rules, but you only bet once.
